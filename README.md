# [Accenture Newletter](http://designexplorers.net/accenture/) 

## Design

For this newsletter I am using Bootstrap to handle the layout of the page, I have included a full width header image and designed the newsletter to the specs received.  I have also included a footer with social media links and copyright information.

## Styling

I used the colour pallet from the header image to pick the colours for the rest of the site.  I wanted to avoid any loud distracting colours that would take away from the content.
