# [Accenture Newletter](http://designexplorers.net/accenture/) 

## Design

For this newsletter I am using Bootstrap to handle the layout of the page, I have included a full width header image and designed the newsletter to the specs received.  I have also included a footer with social media links and copyright information.  Using photoshop I have adjusted the size of some of the images to better fit with the rest of the content.  I have added icons to highlight the phone number and the winner link.

The page is fully responsive and will adapt to the screen size the client is using to view the page.  The layout changes from multi column viewing on larger devices to single column on smaller devices.

For the "Stuck for exercise ideas" section I have adjusted the layout from the spec sheet to better fit when viewing on larger devices, I have put the lead image to the left of the list.  On smaller devices the image will be above the list.  I have also used a interactive list that the user can click on the reveal the content under each heading.

### Note:

The registration link is missing from the spec sheet, I have included this section in the code but have commented it out until the info is available.  The section is highlighted in the code so it can easily be updated by myself or another member of the team. 


## Styling

I used the colour pallet from the header image to pick the colours for the rest of the site.  I wanted to avoid any loud distracting colours that would take away from the content.  The soothing light blue colour highlights the 3-column section and using the Adobe colour tool I selected a complementary colour to highlight the important Heart Check section.  I wanted to avoid any distracting animations so I have used a simple fade in animation for each section as the user scrolls down the page.  The animation comes from the wow.js and animate.js plugins.  I am using the font-awesome plugin and the Lato font on the page for clear easily readable text.
